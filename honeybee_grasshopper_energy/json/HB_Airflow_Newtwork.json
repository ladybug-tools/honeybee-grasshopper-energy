  "description": "Set up a Honeybee Model to use the EnergyPlus Airflow Network (AFN) for all airflow\nin the energy simulation.\n_\nCompared to the default single-zone methods that Honeybee uses for infiltration\nand ventilation, the AFN represents air flow in a manner that is truer to the fluid\ndynamic behavior of real buildings. In particular, the AFN more accurately models\nthe flow of air from one zone to another, accounting for the pressure changes\ninduced by wind and air density differences. However, using the AFN means that\nthe simulation will take considerably longer to run compared to the single zone\noption and the difference in simuation resuts is only likely to be significant\nwhen the Model contains operable windows or the building is extremely leaky.\n_\nPassing a Honeybee Model through this component before energy simulation will\nresult in the following changes to the EnergyPlus IDF:\n_\n1. All ZoneInfiltration objects will be excluded and, instead, infitration will\nbe modeled with AFN Crack objects assigned to each opaque Face.\n_\n2. For all AirBoundary Faces within the Model, ZoneMixing objects will be excluded\nand, instead, the air boundary will be modeled with AFN Crack objects that have\nvery large pressure coefficients derived from the orifice equation and the area\nof the air wall.\n_\n3. For all operable Apertures, ZoneVentilation:WindandStackOpenArea objects will\nbe excluded and, instead, these opearable apertures will be modeled with AFN\nSimpleOpening objects.\n_\n4. For each Room with a VentilationControl object to specify setpoints at which\nthe windows open, an Energy Management System (EMS) program will be written to\ndictate when the operable Apertures of the Room open.\n-"
