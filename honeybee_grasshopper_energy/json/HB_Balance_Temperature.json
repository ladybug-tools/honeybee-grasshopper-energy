  "description": "Calculate a building (or zone) balance temperature from a ideal air load simulation\nresults. The balance point is the outdoor temperature at which a building switches\nbetween heating and cooling.\n_\nIf the outdoor temperture drops below the balance temperature, the building will\nusually be in heating mode and, if the outdoor temperture is above the balance\ntemperature, the building will usually be in cooling mode.\n_\nThe balance temperture concept is useful for setting things such as automated\nblinds and airflow schedules since having these things directly controlled by\nhourly cooling or heating demand isn't always straightforward.\n_\nThis component works by taking the average combined heating/cooling values for\neach day and the average outdoor air temperature for each day. The days with\nthe smallest combined heating + cooling will have their daily mean outdoor air\ntempertures averaged to produce the output balance temperture.\n-"
