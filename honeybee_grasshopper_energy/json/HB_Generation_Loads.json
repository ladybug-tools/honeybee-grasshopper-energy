For a\nsystem with a high DC to AC size ratio, during times when the\nDC power output exceeds the inverter's rated DC input size, the inverter\nlimits the array's power output by increasing the DC operating voltage,\nwhich moves the arrays operating point down its current-voltage (I-V)\ncurve. The default value of 1.1 is reasonable for most systems. A\ntypical range is 1.1 to 1.25, although some large-scale systems have\nratios of as high as 1.5.
