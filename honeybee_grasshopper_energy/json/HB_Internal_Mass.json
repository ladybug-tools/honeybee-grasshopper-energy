Several of these\ncomponents can be used in a series to descibe different internal masses made\nof different materials.\n_\nNote that internal masses assigned this way cannot \"see\" solar radiation that\nmay potentially hit them and, as such, caution should be taken when using this\ncomponent with internal mass objects that are not always in shade.
