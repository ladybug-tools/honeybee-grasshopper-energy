A simple window\nview factor calculation will be used to distribute incoming diffuse\nsolar energy between interior surfaces.\n1 = \"FullExterior\" - The simulation will perform the solar calculation\nin a manner that only accounts for direct sun and whether it is\nblocked by surrounding context geometry.  For the inside of the\nbuilding, all beam solar radiation entering the zone is assumed\nto fall on the floor. A simple window view factor calculation will\nbe used to distribute incoming diffuse solar energy between\ninterior surfaces.\n2 = \"FullInteriorAndExterior\" - The simulation will perform the solar\ncalculation in a manner that models the direct sun (and wheter it\nis blocked by outdoor context goemetry.
