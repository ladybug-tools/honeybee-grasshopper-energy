For Exhaust\nventilation, the conditions of the air entering the space are assumed\nto be equivalent to outside air conditions. For Intake and Balanced\nventilation, an appropriate amount of fan heat is added to the\nentering air stream. For Balanced ventilation, both an intake fan\nand an exhaust fan are assumed to co-exist, both having the same\nflow rate and power consumption (using the entered values for fan\npressure rise and fan total efficiency). Thus, the fan electric\nconsumption for Balanced ventilation is twice that for the Exhaust or\nIntake ventilation types which employ only a single fan.

The pressure rise plays an important role in\ndetermining the amount of energy consumed by the fan. Smaller fans like\na 0.05 m3/s desk fan tend to have lower pressure rises around 60 Pa.\nLarger fans, such as a 6 m3/s fan used for ventilating a large room tend\nto have higher pressure rises around 400 Pa. The highest pressure rises\nare typically for large fans blowing air through ducts and filters, which\ncan have pressure rises as high as 1000 Pa. If this input is None,\nthe pressure rise will be estimated from the flow_rate, with higher\nflow rates corresponding to larger pressure rises (up to 400 Pa). These\nestimated pressure rises are generally assumed to have minimal obstructions\nbetween the fan and the room and they should be increased if the fan is\nblowing air through ducts or filters.",

Fans that have a higher blade\ndiameter and operate at lower speeds with smaller pressure rises for\ntheir size tend to have higher efficiencies. Because motor efficiencies\nare typically between 0.8 and 0.9, the best overall fan efficiencies\ntend to be around 0.7 with most typical fan efficiencies between 0.5 and\n0.7. The lowest efficiencies often happen for small fans in situations\nwith high pressure rises for their size, which can result in efficiencies\nas low as 0.15. If None, this input will be estimated from the fan\nflow rate and pressure rise with large fans operating at low pressure\nrises for their size having up to 0.7 efficiency and small fans\noperating at high pressure rises for their size having as low as\n0.15 efficiency.",
