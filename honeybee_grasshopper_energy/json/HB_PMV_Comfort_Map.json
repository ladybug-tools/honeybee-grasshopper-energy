  "description": "Compute spatially-resolved operative temperature and Predicted Mean Vote (PMV)\nthermal comfort from a Honeybee model. This recipe can also (optionally)\ncompute Standard Effective Temperature (SET).\n_\nThis recipe uses EnergyPlus to obtain surface temperatures and indoor air\ntemperatures + humidities. Outdoor air temperatures, relative humidities, and\nair speeds are taken directly from the EPW. The energy properties of the model\ngeometry are what determine the outcome of the simulation, though the model's\nRadiance sensor grids are what determine where the comfort mapping occurs.\n_\nLongwave radiant temperatures are obtained by computing spherical view factors\nfrom each sensor to the Room surfaces of the model using Radiance. These view factors\nare then multiplied by the surface temperatures output by EnergyPlus to yield\nlongwave MRT at each sensor. All indoor shades (eg. those representing furniture)\nare assumed to be at the room-average MRT.\n_\nA Radiance-based enhanced 2-phase method is used for all shortwave MRT calculations,\nwhich precisely represents direct sun by tracing a ray from each sensor to the\nsolar position. To determine Thermal Comfort Percent (TCP), the occupancy schedules\nof the energy model are used. Any hour of the occupancy schedule that is 0.1 or\ngreater will be considered occupied. All hours of the outdoors are considered occupied.\n-"
