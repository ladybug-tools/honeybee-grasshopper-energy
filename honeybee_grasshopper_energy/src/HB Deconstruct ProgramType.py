Deconstruct a ProgramType object into its component load objects.
-

    Args:
        _program: A ProgramType object or text for the identifier of a ProgramType
            to be looked up in the program type library.
    
    Returns:
        people: A People object that describes the occupancy of the program. If None,
            no people are assumed to occupy the program.
        lighting: A Lighting object that describes the lighting usage of the program.
            If None, no lights are assumed to be installed.
        electric_equip: An ElectricEquipment object to describe the usage
            of electric equipment within the program. If None, no electric equipment
            is assumed to be installed.
        gas_equip: A GasEquipment object to describe the usage of gas equipment
            within the program. If None, no gas equipment is assumed to be installed.
        hot_water: A ServiceHotWater object to describe the usage of hot water within
            the program. If None, no hot water is be assumed for the program.
        infiltration: An Infiltration object to describe the outdoor air leakage of
            the program. If None, no infiltration is be assumed for the program.
        ventilation: A Ventilation object to describe the minimum outdoor air
            requirement of the program. If None, no ventilation requirement is
            be assumed for the program.
        setpoint: A Setpoint object to describe the temperature and humidity
            setpoints of the program.  If None, the ProgramType cannot be assigned
            to a Room that is conditioned.
