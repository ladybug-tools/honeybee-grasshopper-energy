"""
Run an IDF file through EnergyPlus.

-
    Args:
        _idf: Path to an IDF file as a text string. This can also be a list of
            IDF files.
        _epw_file: Path to an .epw file as a text string.
        add_str_: THIS OPTION IS JUST FOR ADVANCED USERS OF ENERGYPLUS.
            You can input additional text strings here that you would like
            written into the IDF.  The strings input here should be complete
            EnergyPlus objects that are correctly formatted. This input can be used to
            write objects into the IDF that are not currently supported by Honeybee.
        _cpu_count_: An integer to set the number of CPUs used in the execution of each
            connected IDF file. If unspecified, it will automatically default
            to one less than the number of CPUs currently available on the
            machine (or 1 if only one processor is available).
        _run: Set to "True" to run the IDF through EnergyPlus.
            _
            This input can also be the integer "2", which will run the whole
            simulation silently (without any batch windows).

    Returns:
        report: Check here to see a report of the EnergyPlus run.
        sql: The file path of the SQL result file that has been generated on your
            machine.
        zsz: Path to a .csv file containing detailed zone load information recorded
            over the course of the design days.
        rdd: The file path of the Result Data Dictionary (.rdd) file that is
            generated after running the file through EnergyPlus.  This file
            contains all possible outputs that can be requested from the EnergyPlus
            model.  Use the Read Result Dictionary component to see what outputs
            can be requested.
        html: The HTML file path of the Summary Reports. Note that this will be None
            unless the input _sim_par_ denotes that an HTML report is requested and
            _run is set to True.
