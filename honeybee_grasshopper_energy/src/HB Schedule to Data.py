"""
Get a ladybug DataCollection representing this schedule at a given timestep.
_
This DataCollection can be used to visualize timeseries schedule values over
the entire period of a simulation using a component like the "LB Hourly Plot".
_
This DataCollection can also be used in the crafting of conditional statements
with the ladybug components. For example, making a psychrometric chart of zone
temperature/humidity for only the hours that the occupancy schedule is above a
certain threshold.
-

    Args:
        _schedule: A ScheduleRuleSet or SchedileFixedInterval for which a DataCollection
            of timeseries schedule values will be produced. This can also be the
            identifier of a Schedule to be looked up in the schedule library.
        analysis_period_: An optional AnalysisPeriod to set the start and end datetimes
            of the resulting DataCollection. The timestep of this AnalysisPeriod
            will also be used to determine the timestep of the resulting DataCollection.
        _week_start_day_: An optional text string to set the start day of the week
            of the schedule timeseries data. Default: Sunday. Choose from the following:
                * Sunday
                * Monday
                * Tuesday
                * Wednesday
                * Thursday
                * Friday
                * Saturday
        holidays_: An optional list of strings (eq: 25 Dec) to represent the holidays
            in the resulting timeseries. Holiday schedules will be used for these
            dates in the resulting timeseries.
    
    Returns:
        data: A ladybug DataCollection representing the timeseries values of the schedule.
            This can be used to visualize timeseries schedule values over the entire
            period of a simulation using a component like the "LB Hourly Plot".
