"""
Apply an All-Air template HVAC to a list of Honeybee Rooms.
_
All-air systems provide both ventilation and satisfaction of heating + cooling
demand with the same stream of warm/cool air. As such, they often grant tight
control over zone humidity. However, because such systems often involve the
cooling of air only to reheat it again, they are often more energy intensive
than systems that separate ventilation from the meeting of thermal loads.

    Args:
        _rooms: Honeybee Rooms to which the input template HVAC will be assigned.
            This can also be a Honeybee Model for which all conditioned Rooms
            will be assigned the HVAC system.
        _system_type: Text for the specific type of all-air system and equipment.
            The "HB All-Air HVAC Templates" component has a full list of the
            supported all-air system templates.
        _vintage_: Text for the vintage of the template system. This will be used
            to set efficiencies for various pieces of equipment within the system.
            The "HB Building Vintages" component has a full list of supported
            HVAC vintages. (Default: ASHRAE_2013).
        _name_: Text to set the name for the HVAC system and to be incorporated into
            unique HVAC identifier. If the name is not provided, a random name
            will be assigned.
        _economizer_: Text to indicate the type of air-side economizer used on the
            HVAC system. Economizers will mix in a greater amount of outdoor
            air to cool the zone (rather than running the cooling system) when
            the zone needs cooling and the outdoor air is cooler than the zone.
            Choose from the options below. (Default: NoEconomizer).
                * NoEconomizer
                * DifferentialDryBulb
                * DifferentialEnthalpy
                * DifferentialDryBulbAndEnthalpy
                * FixedDryBulb
                * FixedEnthalpy
                * ElectronicEnthalpy
        sensible_hr_: A number between 0 and 1 for the effectiveness of sensible
            heat recovery within the system. Typical values range from 0.5 for
            simple glycol loops to 0.81 for enthalpy wheels (the latter tends to
            be fiarly expensive for air-based systems). (Default: 0).
        latent_hr_: A number between 0 and 1 for the effectiveness of latent heat
            recovery within the system. Typical values are 0 for all types of
            heat recovery except enthalpy wheels, which can have values as high
            as 0.76. (Default: 0).
        dcv_: Boolean to note whether demand controlled ventilation should be
            used on the system, which will vary the amount of ventilation air
            according to the occupancy schedule of the zone. (Default: False).

    Returns:
        rooms: The input Rooms with an all-air HVAC system applied.
