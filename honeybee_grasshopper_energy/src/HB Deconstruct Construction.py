"""
Deconstruct an opaque or window construction into its constituient materials.
-

    Args:
        _constr: An opaque or window construction to be deconstructed. This can
            also be text for an opaque or window construction to be looked
            up in the construction library.

    Returns:
        materials: List of material objects that make up the construction
            (ordered from outside to inside).
        layers: List of material identifiers that make up the construction
            (ordered from outside to inside).
        r_val_si: R-value of the construction in m2-K/W. Note that R-values do NOT
            include the resistance of air films on either side of the construction.
        r_val_ip: R-value of the construction in h-ft2-F/Btu. Note that R-values do NOT
            include the resistance of air films on either side of the construction.
        u_fac_si: U-factor of the construction in W/m2-K.  Note that U-factors
            include the resistance of air films on either side of the construction.
        u_fac_ip: U-factor of the construction in Btu/h-ft2-F.  Note that U-factors
            include the resistance of air films on either side of the construction.
        shgc: The estimated solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) of the construction.
            This value is produced by finding the solution to the relationship between
            U-value, Solar Transmittance, and SHGC as defined for the simple glazing
            system material in EnergyPlus. More information can be found
            at https://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/9-5/engineering-reference/
            on this partticular sub-page of the engineering reference:
            window-calculation-module.html#step-4.-determine-layer-solar-transmittance
        t_sol: The unshaded shortwave solar transmittance of the construction at normal
            incidence. Note that 'unshaded' in this case means that all blind +
            shade materials in the construction are ignored.
        t_vis: The unshaded visible transmittance of the window at normal incidence.
            Note that 'unshaded' in this case means that all blind + shade
            materials in the construction are ignored.
