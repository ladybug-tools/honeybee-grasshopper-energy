"""
Change the properties of Honeybee Rooms to reflect those of a ground surface.
_
This is particularly useful for setting up outdoor thermal comfort maps that account
for the surface temperature of the ground. Modeling the ground as a room this way
will ensure that shadows other objects cast upon it are accounted for along with
the storage of heat in the ground surface.
_
The turning of a Room into a ground entails:
_
* Setting all constructions to be indicative of a certain soil type.
* Setting all Faces except the roof to have a Ground boundary condition.
* Removing all loads and schedules assigned to the Room.
_
All values for the typical soil_types are taken from the Engineering Toolbox,
specifically these pages:
Soil Conductivity - http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/thermal-conductivity-d_429.html
Soil Density - http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/dirt-mud-densities-d_1727.html
Soil Heat Capacity - http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/specific-heat-capacity-d_391.html
-

    Args:
        _rooms: Honeybee Rooms to be converted into ground objects.
        _soil_constr_: An OpaqueConstruction that reflects the soil type of the ground.
            This can also be text for a construction to be looked up in the opaque
            construction library. If a multi-layered construction is input, the multiple
            layers will only be used for the roof Face of the Room and all other
            Faces will get a construction with the inner-most layer assigned. Some
            common types of soil constructions contained in the default honeybee
            standards library are listed below. (Default: Concrete Pavement).
            _
            Dry Sand
            Dry Dust
            Moist Soil
            Mud
            Concrete Pavement
            Asphalt Pavement
            Solid Rock

    Returns:
        rooms: Rooms that have had their properties altered to be representative of
            ground conditions.
