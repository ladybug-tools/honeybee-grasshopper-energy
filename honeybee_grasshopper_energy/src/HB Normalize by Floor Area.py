"""
Normalize Zone-level data collections from an energy simulation by the by the
floor area of the corresponding honeybee Rooms.
-

    Args:
        _data: A list of HourlyContinuousCollections of the same data type, which
            will be normalized by room floor area. Data collections can be of any class
            (eg. MonthlyCollection, DailyCollection) but they should originate
            from an energy simulation sql (with header metadata that has 'Zone' or
            'System' keys). These keys will be used to match the data in the collections
            to the input rooms.
        _model: An array of honeybee Rooms or a honeybee Model, which will
            be matched to the data collections. The length of these Rooms does
            not have to match the data collections and this object will only
            output collections for rooms that are found to be matching.

    Returns:
        total_data: The total results normalized by the floor area of all connected
            rooms. This accounts for the fact that some rooms have more floor
            area (or have a multiplier) and therefore get a greater weighting.
        room_data: The results normalized by the floor area of each individual room.
