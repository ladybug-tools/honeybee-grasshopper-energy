"""
Compute spatially-resolved operative temperature and PMV thermal comfort from
a Honeybee model. This recipe can also (optionally) compute Standard Effective
Temperature (SET).
_
This recipe uses EnergyPlus to obtain longwave radiant temperatures and indoor air
temperatures. The outdoor air temperature and air speed are taken directly from
the EPW. A Radiance-based, enhanced 2-phase method is used for shortwave MRT
calculations, which uses an accurate direct sun calculation with precise solar
positions.
_
The energy properties of the model geometry are what determine the outcome of the
simulation, though the model's Radiance sensor grids are what determine where
the comfort mapping occurs.
-

    Args:
        _model: A Honeybee Model for which PMV comfort will be mapped. Note that
            this model should have radiance grids assigned to it in order
            to produce meaningful results.
        _epw: Path to an EPW weather file to be used for the comfort map simulation.
        _ddy: Path to a DDY file with design days to be used for the initial sizing
            calculation of the energy simulation.
        north_: A number between -360 and 360 for the counterclockwise difference
            between the North and the positive Y-axis in degrees. This can
            also be Vector for the direction to North. (Default: 0).
        run_period_: An AnalysisPeriod to set the start and end dates of the simulation.
            If None, the simulation will be annual.
        write_set_map_: A boolean to note whether the output temperature CSV should
            record Operative Temperature or Standard Effective Temperature (SET).
            SET is relatively intense to compute and so only recording Operative
            Temperature can greatly reduce run time, particularly when air speeds
            are low. However, SET accounts for all 6 PMV model inputs and so is a
            more representative "feels-like" temperature for the PMV model.
        _air_speed_: A single number for air speed in m/s or an hourly data collection
            of air speeds that align with the input run_period_. This will be
            used for all indoor comfort evaluation. Note that the EPW wind speed
            will be used for any outdoor sensors. (Default: 0.1).
        _met_rate_: A single number for metabolic rate in met or an hourly data collection
            of met rates that align with the run_period_. (Default: 1.1, for
            seated, typing).
        _clo_value_: A single number for clothing level in clo or an hourly data collection
            of clothing levels that align with the run_period_. (Default: 0.7,
            for pants and a long sleeve shirt).
        comfort_par_: Optional comfort parameters from the "LB PMV Comfort Parameters"
            component to specify the criteria under which conditions are
            considered acceptable/comfortable. The default will assume a
            PPD threshold of 10% and no absolute humidity constraints.
        solar_body_par_: Optional solar body parameters from the "LB Solar Body Parameters"
            object to specify the properties of the human geometry assumed in the
            shortwave MRT calculation. The default assumes average skin/clothing
            absorptivity and a human subject always has their back to the sun
            at a 45-degree angle (SHARP = 135).
        radiance_par_: Text for the radiance parameters to be used for ray
            tracing. (Default: -ab 2 -ad 5000 -lw 2e-05).
        run_settings_: Settings from the "HB Recipe Settings" component that specify
            how the recipe should be run. This can also be a text string of
            recipe settings.
        _run: Set to True to run the recipe and get results. This input can also be
            the integer "2" to run the recipe silently.

    Returns:
        report: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
        temperature: A folder containing CSV maps of Operative Temperature for each sensor
            grid at each time step of the analysis. Alternatively, if the
            write_set_map_ option is used, the CSV maps here will contain
            Standard Effective Temperature (SET). This can be connected to the
            "HB Read Thermal Matrix" component to parse detailed results into
            Grasshopper. Values are in Celsius.
        condition: A folder containing CSV maps of comfort conditions for each sensor
            grid at each time step of the analysis. This can be connected to the
            "HB Read Thermal Matrix" component to parse detailed results into
            Grasshopper. Values are as follows.
                * -1 = unacceptably cold conditions
                *  0 = neutral (comfortable) conditions
                * +1 = unacceptably hot conditions
        pmv: A folder containing CSV maps of the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) for each
            sensor grid at each time step of the analysis. This can be connected
            to the "HB Read Thermal Matrix" component to parse detailed results
            into Grasshopper. This can be used to understand not just whether
            conditions are acceptable but how uncomfortably hot or cold they are.
        TCP: Lists of values between 0 and 100 for the Thermal Comfort Percent (TCP).
            These can be plugged into the "LB Spatial Heatmap" component along
            with meshes of the sensor grids to visualize spatial thermal comfort.
            TCP is the percentage of occupied time where thermal conditions are
            acceptable/comfortable. Occupied hours are determined from the
            occupancy schedules of each room (any time where the occupancy
            schedule is >= 0.1 will be considered occupied). Outdoor sensors
            are considered occupied at all times. More custom TCP studies can
            be done by post-processing the condition results.
        HSP: Lists of values between 0 and 100 for the Heat Sensation Percent (HSP).
            These can be plugged into the "LB Spatial Heatmap" component along with
            meshes of the sensor grids to visualize uncomfortably hot locations.
            HSP is the percentage of occupied time where thermal conditions are
            hotter than what is considered acceptable/comfortable. Occupied hours
            are determined from the occupancy schedules of each room (any time
            where the occupancy schedule is >= 0.1 will be considered occupied).
            Outdoor sensors are considered occupied at all times. More custom HSP
            studies can be done by post-processing the condition results.
        CSP: Lists of values between 0 and 100 for the Cold Sensation Percent (CSP).
            These can be plugged into the "LB Spatial Heatmap" component along with
            meshes of the sensor grids to visualize uncomfortably cold locations.
            CSP is the percentage of occupied time where thermal conditions are
            colder than what is considered acceptable/comfortable. Occupied hours
            are determined from the occupancy schedules of each room (any time
            where the occupancy schedule is >= 0.1 will be considered occupied).
            Outdoor sensors are considered occupied at all times. More custom CSP
            studies can be done by post-processing the condition results.
