"""
Separate data collections of energy simulation results by object and face type.
Input data must be for Faces, Apertures, Doors, or any combination of these objects.
_
This component can also be used to normalize such data by area.
-

    Args:
        _data: A list of data collections output from an energy simulation, which
            will be separated by object and face type. Data collections can be
            of any class (eg. MonthlyCollection, DailyCollection) but they
            should all have headers with metadata dictionaries with 'Surface'
            keys. These keys will be used to match the data in the collections
            to the input faces.
        _hb_objs: An array of honeybee Rooms, Faces, Apertures or Doors, which will
            be matched with the _data. This can also be an entire Model.
        norm_: Boolean to note whether results should be normalized by the face/sub-face
            area if the data type of the data_colections supports it. (Default: False)

    Returns:
        walls: Data collections with results for Walls with an Outdoors or Ground
            boundary condition.
        interior_walls: Data collections with results for Walls with a Surface or
            Adiabatic boundary condition.
        roofs: Data collections with results for RoofCeilings with an Outdoors or
            Ground boundary condition.
        ceilings: Data collections with results for RoofCeilings with a Surface
            or Adiabatic boundary condition.
        exterior_floors: Data collections with results for Floors with an Outdoors
            or Ground boundary condition.
        interior_floors: Data collections with results for Floors with a Surface
            or Adiabatic boundary condition.
        apertures: Data collections with results for Apertures with an Outdoors
            boundary condition.
        interior_apertures: Data collections with results for Apertures with a
            Surface boundary condition.
        doors: Data collections with results for Doors with an Outdoors boundary
            condition.
        interior_doors: Data collections with results for Doors with a Surface
            boundary condition.
