"""
Deconstruct an Equipment object into its constituient properties.
-

    Args:
        _equip: An ElectricEquipment or a GasEquipment object to be deconstructed.
    
    Returns:
        name_: Text string for the equipment display name.
         watts_per_area: A numerical value for the equipment power density in
            Watts per square meter of floor area.
        schedule: A fractional for the use of equipment over the course of the year.
            The fractional values will get multiplied by the watts_per_area to
            yield a complete equipment profile.
        radiant_fract: A number between 0 and 1 for the fraction of the total
            equipment load given off as long wave radiant heat.
        latent_fract: A number between 0 and 1 for the fraction of the total
            equipment load that is latent (as opposed to sensible).
        lost_fract: A number between 0 and 1 for the fraction of the total
            equipment load that is lost outside of the zone and the HVAC system.
            Typically, this is used to represent heat that is exhausted directly
            out of a zone (as you would for a stove).
        is_gas: Will be True if the input Equipment object is for GasEquipment;
            False if it is for ElectricEquipment.
