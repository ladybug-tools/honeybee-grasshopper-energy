"""
Deconstruct a Lighting object into its constituient properties.
-

    Args:
        _lighting: A Lighting object to be deconstructed.
    
    Returns:
        name: Text string for the lighting display name.
         watts_per_area: A numerical value for the lighting power density in
            Watts per square meter of floor area.
        schedule: A fractional for the use of lights over the course of the year.
            The fractional values will get multiplied by the watts_per_area to
            yield a complete lighting profile.
        radiant_fract: A number between 0 and 1 for the fraction of the total
            lighting load given off as long wave radiant heat.
        visible_fract: A number between 0 and 1 for the fraction of the total
            lighting load given off as short wave visible light.
        return_fract: A number between 0 and 1 for the fraction of the total
            lighting load that goes into the zone return air.
        baseline: The baseline lighting power density in W/m2 of floor area. This
            baseline is useful to track how much better the installed lights
            are in comparison to a standard like ASHRAE 90.1.
