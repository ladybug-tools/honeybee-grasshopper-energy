Write a honeybee Model to an OSM file (OpenStudio Model), which can then be translated
to an IDF file and then run through EnergyPlus.

-
    Args:
        _model: A honeybee model object possessing all geometry and corresponding
            energy simulation properties.
        _epw_file: Path to an .epw file on this computer as a text string.
        _sim_par_: A honeybee Energy SimulationParameter object that describes all
            of the setting for the simulation. If None, some default simulation
            parameters will automatically be used.
        measures_: An optional list of measures to apply to the OpenStudio model
            upon export. Use the "HB Load Measure" component to load a measure
            into Grasshopper and assign input arguments. Measures can be
            downloaded from the NREL Building Components Library (BCL) at
            (https://bcl.nrel.gov/).
        add_str_: THIS OPTION IS JUST FOR ADVANCED USERS OF ENERGYPLUS.
            You can input additional text strings here that you would like
            written into the IDF.  The input here should be complete EnergyPlus
            objects as a single string following the IDF format. This input ca
            be used to write objects into the IDF that are not currently supported
            by Honeybee.
        _folder_: An optional folder on this computer, into which the IDF and result
            files will be written.
        _write: Set to "True" to write out the honeybee jsons (containing the Honeybee
            Model and Simulation Parameters) and write the OpenStudio Workflow
            (.osw) file with instructions for executing the simulation.
        run_: Set to "True" to translate the Honeybee jsons to an OpenStudio Model
            (.osm) and EnergyPlus Input Data File (.idf) and then simulate the
            .idf in EnergyPlus. This will ensure that all result files appear
            in their respective outputs from this component.
            _
            This input can also be the integer "2", which will only translate the
            honeybee jsons to an osm and idf format without running the model
            through EnergyPlus.
            _
            It can also be the integer "3", which will run the whole translation
            and simulation silently (without any batch windows).

    Returns:
        report: Check here to see a report of the EnergyPlus run.
        jsons: The file paths to the honeybee JSON files that describe the Model and
            SimulationParameter. These will be translated to an OpenStudio model.
        osw: File path to the OpenStudio Workflow JSON on this machine. This workflow
            is executed using the OpenStudio command line interface (CLI) and
            it includes measures to translate the Honeybee model JSON as well
            as any other connected measures_.
        osm: The file path to the OpenStudio Model (OSM) that has been generated
            on this computer.
        idf: The file path of the EnergyPlus Input Data File (IDF) that has been
            generated on this computer.
        sql: The file path of the SQL result file that has been generated on this
            computer. This will be None unless run_ is set to True.
        zsz: Path to a .csv file containing detailed zone load information recorded
            over the course of the design days. This will be None unless run_ is
            set to True.
        rdd: The file path of the Result Data Dictionary (.rdd) file that is
            generated after running the file through EnergyPlus.  This file
            contains all possible outputs that can be requested from the EnergyPlus
            model. Use the "HB Read Result Dictionary" component to see what outputs
            can be requested.
        html: The HTML file path containing all requested Summary Reports.
