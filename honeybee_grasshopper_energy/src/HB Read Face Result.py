"""
Parse all of the common Room-level comfort-related results from an SQL result
file that has been generated from an energy simulation.

-
    Args:
        _sql: The file path of the SQL result file that has been generated from
            an energy simulation.
    
    Returns:
        face_indoor_temp: DataCollections for the indoor surface temperature of
            each surface (C).
        face_outdoor_temp: DataCollections for the outdoor surface temperature
            of each surface (C).
        face_energy_flow: DataCollections for the heat loss (negative) or heat
            gain (positive) through each building surfaces (kWh).
        opaque_energy_flow: DataCollections for the heat loss (negative) or
            heat gain (positive) through each building opaque surface (kWh).
        window_energy_flow: DataCollections for the heat loss (negative) or
            heat gain (positive) through each building glazing surface (kWh).
            Note that the value here includes both solar gains and conduction
            losses/gains.
