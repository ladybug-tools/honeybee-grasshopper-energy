"""
Write a honeybee Model to an IDF file and then run it through EnergyPlus.

-
    Args:
        _model: A honeybee model object possessing all geometry and corresponding
            energy simulation properties.
        _epw_file: Path to an .epw file on your system as a text string.
        _sim_par_: A honeybee Energy SimulationParameter object that describes all
            of the setting for the simulation. If None, some default simulation
            parameters will automatically be used.
        add_str_: THIS OPTION IS JUST FOR ADVANCED USERS OF ENERGYPLUS.
            You can input additional text strings here that you would like
            written into the IDF.  The strings input here should be complete
            EnergyPlus objects that are correctly formatted. This input can be used to
            write objects into the IDF that are not currently supported by Honeybee.
        _folder_: An optional folder on your system, into which your IDF and result
            files will be written.  NOTE THAT DIRECTORIES INPUT HERE SHOULD NOT HAVE
            ANY SPACES OR UNDERSCORES IN THE FILE PATH.
        _write: Set to "True" to translate the model to an IDF file.
            The file path of the resulting file will appear in the idf output of
            this component.  Note that only setting this to "True" and not setting
            run_ to "True" will not automatically run the IDF through EnergyPlus.
        run_: Set to "True" to run your IDF through EnergyPlus once it is written.
            This will ensure that result files appear in their respective outputs.
    
    Returns:
        report: Check here to see a report of the EnergyPlus run.
        idf: The file path of the IDF file that has been generated on your machine.
        sql: The file path of the SQL result file that has been generated on your
            machine. This will be None unless run_ is set to True.
        zsz: Path to a .csv file containing detailed zone load information recorded
            over the course of the design days. This will be None unless run_ is
            set to True.
        rdd: The file path of the Result Data Dictionary (.rdd) file that is
            generated after running the file through EnergyPlus.  This file
            contains all possible outputs that can be requested from the EnergyPlus
            model.  Use the Read Result Dictionary component to see what outputs
            can be requested.
        html: The HTML file path of the Summary Reports. Note that this will be None
            unless the input _sim_par_ denotes that an HTML report is requested and
            run_ is set to True.
