"""
Create a schedule using from other ScheduleRulesets and AnalysisPeriods over which
each schedule should be applied.
-

    Args:
        _base_schedule: A ScheduleRuleset that represents the base schedule on
            top of which the other _season_scheds will be applied. This can also
            be text to look up a ScheduleRuleset in the schedule library. Any time
            period that is not covered by the input _analysis_periods will default
            to this schedule. Furthermore, the summer and winter design day schedules
            will be taken from this schedule as well as the ScheduleTypeLimits.
        _season_scheds: A list of ScheduleRulesets that align with the _analysis_periods
            below and represent the schedules that will be applied over the
            _base_schedule for the duration of the respective AnalysisPeriod.
            This can also be text to look up ScheduleRulesets in the schedule
            library.
        _analysis_periods: A list of AnalysusPeriod objects that align with the
            _season_scheds and represent the time periods over which each season
            schedule should be applied. Note that, if these AnalysisPeriods
            overlap with one another, then the schedules that come later in
            this list will overwrite those that come earlier in the list for
            the duration of the overlapping time period.
        _name_: Text to set the name for the Schedule and to be incorporated
            into a unique Schedule identifier.

    Returns:
        report: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
        schedule: A ScheduleRuleset object that can be assigned to a Room, a Load
            object, or a ProgramType object.
        idf_year: Text string for the EnergyPlus ScheduleYear that will ultimately
            be written into the IDF for simulation. This can also be used to add
            the schedule to the schedule library that is loaded up upon the start
            of Honeybee by copying this text into the honeybee/library/schedules/
            user_library.idf file along with the other idf text outputs.
        idf_week: Text string for the EnergyPlus ScheduleWeek that will ultimately
            be written into the IDF for simulation. This can also be used to add
            the schedule to the schedule library that is loaded up upon the start
            of Honeybee by copying this text into the honeybee/library/schedules/
            user_library.idf file along with the other idf text outputs.
        idf_days: Text strings for the EnergyPlus SchedulDays that will ultimately
            be written into the IDF for simulation. This can also be used to add
            the schedule to the schedule library that is loaded up upon the start
            of Honeybee by copying this text into the honeybee/library/schedules/
            user_library.idf file along with the other idf text outputs.
