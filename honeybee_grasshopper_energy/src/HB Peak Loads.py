Run Honeybee Rooms through a quick energy simulation to obtain an estimate of
room-level peak cooling and heating on summer and winter design days.
-

    Args:
        _rooms: A list of Honeybee Rooms for which peak loads will be computed.
        shades_: An optional list of Honeybee Shades that can block the sun to
            the input _rooms.
        _ddy_file: Path to a .ddy file on your system as a text string, which contains
            design day conditions for the peak load analysis. This can also
            be the path to an .epw file, in which case design days will be
            determined by statitically analysing the annual data to approximate
            0.4% and 99.6% design conditions.
            _
            Note that custom .ddy files can be crafted from EPW or STAT data
            using the "LB EPW to DDY" component. They can also also be created
            from raw sets of outdoor conditions using the "DF Construct Design
            Day" and "DF Write DDY" components.
            _
            When constructing custom DDY files, it is recommended that the .ddy
            file contain only one summer and one winter design day. Alternatively,
            if you wish to specify multiple cooling design day conditions for
            each month of the year (to evaluate solar load in each month),
            each of these cooling design days should contain "0.4%" in the
            design day name along with " DB=>MWB". This convention will
            automatically be followed when using the "monthly_cool_" option
            on the "LB EPW to DDY" component.
            _
            In this situation of multiple monthly cooling design days, this
            component will report peak_cool zone sizes that correspond to the
            highest month for each zone and the output cooling data collection
            will be for the month with the highest coincident peak cooling.
        _north_: A number between -360 and 360 for the counterclockwise difference
            between the North and the positive Y-axis in degrees.
            90 is West and 270 is East. (Default: 0).
        _timestep_: An integer for the number of timesteps per hour at which the energy
            simulation will be run and results reported. It is recommended that
            this be at least 6 but it can be increased to better capture
            the minute in which peak cooling occurs. (Default: 6).
            The following values are acceptable:
            (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60)
        run_bal_: Set to True to have the load balance computed after the
            simulation is run. This ensures that data collections for various
            terms of the load balance are output from the "balance".
            This can help explain why the loads are what they are but can
            also increase the component run time. (Default: False).
        _run: Set to "True" to run the simulation to obtain annual loads. This can
            also be the integer 2 to run the simulation while being able to see
            the simulation process (with a batch window).

    Returns:
        report: A report of the energy simulation run.
        peak_cool: A list of numbers that align with the input _rooms and correspond
            to the peak cooling of each room on the summer design day in Watts.
            Note that, for multi-room simulations, the individual room peaks may
            not be coincident, meaning that summing these values together won't
            give a correct sense of the size of cetral cooling equipment serving
            multiple rooms. For such equipment, the max of the cooling data
            collection should be used.
        peak_heat: A list of numbers that align with the input _rooms and correspond
            to the peak heating of each room on the winter design day in Watts.
            Note that, for multi-room simulations, the individual room peaks may
            not be coincident, meaning that summing these values together won't
            give a correct sense of the size of cetral heating equipment serving
            multiple rooms. For such equipment, the max of the heating data
            collection should be used.
        cooling: A Data Collection indicating the combined cooling demand of the rooms
            at each simulation timestep of the summer design day. This can be
            plugged into the "LB Monthly Chart" component to visualize the demand
            or it can be deconstructed with the "LB Deconstruct Data" component
            for analysis.
        heating: A Data Collection indicating the combined heating demand of the rooms
            at each simulation timestepof the winter design day. This can be
            plugged into the "LB Monthly Chart" component to visualize the demand
            or it can be deconstructed with the "LB Deconstruct Data" component
            for analysis.
        cool_bal: A list of data collections for the various terms of the sensible load
            balance that contribute to peak cooling on the summer design day. These
            can be plugged into the "LB Monthly Chart" component (with stack_ set
            to True) to visualize the terms contributing to the peak. Will be
            None unless run_bal_ is set to True.
        heat_bal: A list of data collections for the various terms of the sensible load
            balance that contribute to peak heating on the summer design day. These
            can be plugged into the "LB Monthly Chart" component (with stack_ set
            to True) to visualize the terms contributing to the peak. Will be
            None unless run_bal_ is set to True.
