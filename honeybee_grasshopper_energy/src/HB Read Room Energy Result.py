Parse all of the common Room-level energy-related results from an SQL result file
that has been generated from an energy simulation.

-
    Args:
        _sql: The file path of the SQL result file that has been generated from
            an energy simulation.
    
    Returns:
        cooling: DataCollections for the cooling energy in kWh. For Ideal Air
            loads, this output is the sum of sensible and latent heat that must
            be removed from each room.  For detailed HVAC systems, this output
            will be electric energy needed to power each chiller/cooling coil.
        heating: DataCollections for the heating energy needed in kWh. For Ideal
            Air loads, this is the heat that must be added to each room.  For
            detailed HVAC systems, this will be fuel energy or electric energy
            needed for each boiler/heating element.
        lighting: DataCollections for the electric lighting energy needed for
            each room in kWh.
        electric_equip: DataCollections for the electric equipment energy needed
            for each room in kWh.
        gas_equip: DataCollections for the gas equipment energy needed for each
            room in kWh.
        fan_electric: DataCollections for the fan electric energy in kWh for
            either a ventilation fan or a HVAC system fan.
        pump_electric: DataCollections for the water pump electric energy in kWh
            for a heating/cooling system.
        people_gain: DataCollections for the internal heat gains in each room
            resulting from people (kWh).
        solar_gain: DataCollections for the total solar gain in each room (kWh).
        infiltration_load: DataCollections for the heat loss (negative) or heat
            gain (positive) in each room resulting from infiltration (kWh).
        mech_vent_load: DataCollections for the heat loss (negative) or heat gain
            (positive) in each room resulting from the outdoor air coming through
            the HVAC System (kWh).
        nat_vent_load: DataCollections for the heat loss (negative) or heat gain
            (positive) in each room resulting from natural ventilation (kWh).
