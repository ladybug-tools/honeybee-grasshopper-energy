"""
Filter data collections of energy simulation results using a list of Rooms to
which the simulations relate.
_
This can be used in combination with components like "HB Rooms by Attribute" to
get simulation resutls for subset of rooms (eg. all of the offices).
-

    Args:
        _data: A list of data collections output from an energy simulation, which
            will be filtered based on the input _rooms. Data collections can be
            of any class (eg. MonthlyCollection, DailyCollection) but they
            should originate from an energy simulation sql (with header
            metadata that has 'Zone' or 'System' keys). These keys will be
            used to match the data in the collections to the input rooms.
        _rooms: Honeybee Rooms, which will be matched with the input _data. This can
            also be an enitre Model.
        norm_: Boolean to note whether results should be normalized by the Room floor
            area if the data type of the data_colections supports it. (Default: False)

    Returns:
        data: The input _data filtered by the connected _rooms (and optionally normalized
            by the floor area of each individual room).
