"""
Apply schedules to a Room or ProgramType.
_
Note that, if a schedule is assigned to a Room or ProgramType that posseses
no value for a given load, an error will be raised. For example, assigning a
gas_equip_sch_ to a Room that has no GasEquipment object associated with it.
This situation can be avoided by first passing the Rooms or ProgramTypes
through the "HB Apply Load Values" component to eastablish a value for a
given load.
-

    Args:
        _room_or_program: Honeybee Rooms or Honeybee ProgramType objects for which
            schedules should be changed. This can also be the identifier of a
            ProgramType to be looked up in the program type library.
        occupancy_sch_: A fractional schedule for the occupancy over the course
            of the year. This can also be the identifier of a schedule to be looked
            up in the schedule library.
        activity_sch_: A schedule for the activity of the occupants over the course of the
            year. The type limt of this schedule should be "ActivityLevel"
            and the values of the schedule equal to the number of Watts given off
            by an individual person in the room. If None, it will a default constant
            schedule with 120 Watts per person will be used, which is typical of
            awake, adult humans who are seated.
         heating_setpt_sch_: A temperature schedule for the heating setpoint.
            This can also be a identifier of a schedule to be looked up in the
            schedule library. The type limit of this schedule should be
            temperature and the values should be the temperature setpoint in
            degrees Celcius.
        cooling_setpt_sch_: A temperature schedule for the cooling setpoint.
            This can also be a identifier of a schedule to be looked up in the
            schedule library. The type limit of this schedule should be
            temperature and the values should be the temperature setpoint in
            degrees Celcius.
        lighting_sch_: A fractional for the use of lights over the course of the year.
            This can also be the identifier of a schedule to be looked up in the
            schedule library.
        electric_equip_sch_: A fractional for the use of electric equipment over
            the course of the year. This can also be the identifier of a schedule to
            be looked up in the schedule library.
        gas_equip_sch_: A fractional for the use of gas equipment over
            the course of the year. This can also be the identifier of a schedule to
            be looked up in the schedule library.
        infiltration_sch_: A fractional schedule for the infiltration over the
            course of the year. This can also be the identifier of a schedule to
            be looked up in the schedule library.
        ventilation_sch_: An optional fractional schedule for the ventilation over the
            course of the year. This can also be the identifier of a schedule to be
            looked up in the schedule library. The fractional values will get
            multiplied by the total design flow rate (determined from the fields
            above and the calculation_method) to yield a complete ventilation
            profile. Setting this schedule to be the occupancy schedule of the
            zone will mimic demand controlled ventilation.

    Returns:
        report: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
        mod_obj: The input Rooms or ProgramTypes with their schedules modified.
