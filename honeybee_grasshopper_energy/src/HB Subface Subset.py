"""
Create a list of exterior subface (apertures + doors) constructions that can be
used to edit or create a ConstructionSet object.
-

    Args:
        _window_: A construction object for apertures with an Outdoors boundary
            condition and a Wall face type for their parent face. This can also
            be text for the identifier of the construction within the library.
        _skylight_: A construction object for apertures with an Outdoors boundary
            condition and a RoofCeiling or Floor face type for their parent face.
            This can also be text for the identifier of the construction within
            the library.
        _operable_: A construction object for apertures with an Outdoors boundary
            condition and True is_operable property. This can also be text for
            the identifier of the construction within the library.
        _exterior_door_: A construction object for opaque doors with an Outdoors
            boundary condition and a Wall face type for their parent face. This
            can also be text for the identifier of the construction within
            the library.
        _overhead_door_: A construction object for opaque doors with an Outdoors
            boundary condition and a RoofCeiling or Floor face type for their
            parent face. This can also be text for the identifier of the construction
            within the library.
        _glass_door_: A construction object for all glass doors with an Outdoors
            boundary condition. This can also be text for the identifier of the
            construction within the library.

    Returns:
        subface_set: A list of exterior subface constructions that can be used
            to edit or create a ConstructionSet object.
