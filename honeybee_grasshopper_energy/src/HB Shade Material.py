"""
Create a material for a shade layer in a window construction (like a roller shade).
This material can be plugged into the "HB Window Construction" component.
_
Reflectance and emissivity properties are assumed to be the same on both sides of
the shade. Shades are considered to be perfect diffusers.
-

    Args:
        _name: Text to set the name for the material and to be incorporated into
            a unique material identifier.
        _thickness: Number for the thickness of the shade layer in meters.
        _transmittance_:  Number between 0 and 1 for the transmittance of both solar
            radiation and visible light through the shade. (Default: 0.4, which
            is typical of a white diffusing shade).
        _reflectance_: Number between 0 and 1 for the reflectance of both solar
            radiation and visible light off of the shade. (Default: 0.5,
            which is typical of a white diffusing shade).
        _t_infrared_: Long-wave hemisperical transmittance of the shade. (Default: 0).
        _emissivity_: Number between 0 and 1 for the infrared hemispherical
            emissivity of the shade. (Default: 0.9, which is typical of most
            diffusing shade materials).
        _conductivity_: Number for the thermal conductivity of the shade in
            W/m-K. (Default: 0.05, typical of cotton shades).
        _dist_to_glass_: A number between 0.001 and 1.0 for the distance between the
            shade and neighboring glass layers [m]. (Default: 0.05 (50 mm)).
        _open_mult_: Factor between 0 and 1 that is multiplied by the area at the top,
            bottom and sides of the shade for air flow calculations. (Default: 0.5).
        _permeability_: The fraction of the shade surface that is open to air flow.
            Must be between 0 and 0.8. (Default: 0 for no permeability).

    Returns:
        mat: A material for a shade layer in a window construction (like a roller
            shade) that can be assigned to a Honeybee Window construction.
