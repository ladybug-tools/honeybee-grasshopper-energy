"""
Create a People object that can be used to create a ProgramType or be assigned
directly to a Room.
-

    Args:
        _name_: Text to set the name for the People and to be incorporated
            into a unique People identifier. If None, a unique name will
            be generated.
         _ppl_per_area: A numerical value for the number of people per square
            meter of floor area.
        _occupancy_sch: A fractional schedule for the occupancy over the course
            of the year. The fractional values in this schedule will get multiplied
            by the _people_per_area to yield a complete occupancy profile.
        _activity_sch_: A schedule for the activity of the occupants over the course
            of the year. The type limt of this schedule should be "Activity Level"
            and the values of the schedule equal to the number of Watts given off
            by an individual person in the room. If None, it will a default constant
            schedule with 120 Watts per person will be used, which is typical of
            awake, adult humans who are seated.

    Returns:
        people: A People object that can be used to create a ProgramType or
            be assigned directly to a Room.
