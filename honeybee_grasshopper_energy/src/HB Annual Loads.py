"""
Run Honeybee Rooms through a quick energy simulation to obtain an estimate of
annual heating, cooling, lighting, equipment, and service hot water loads.
_
Note that the default settings used by this component are only suitable for evaluating
annual loads in the case where an error of up to 5% is acceptable. Also
note that annual loads are not the same as annual energy use or utility costs
and, while the "cop" inputs can be used to approximate some effects of real
heating + cooling systems, any evaulation of actual energy use, utility costs,
or GHG emissions should be done by modeling a detailed HVAC using the "HB
Model to OSM" component.
-

    Args:
        _rooms: A list of Honeybee Rooms for which annual loads will be computed.
        shades_: An optional list of Honeybee Shades that can block the sun to
            the input _rooms.
        _epw_file: Path to an .epw file on your system as a text string.
        _north_: A number between -360 and 360 for the counterclockwise difference
            between the North and the positive Y-axis in degrees.
            90 is West and 270 is East. (Default: 0).
        _timestep_: An integer for the number of timesteps per hour at which the
            energy balance calculation will be run. This has a dramatic
            impact on the speed of the simulation and the accuracy of
            results. Higher timesteps lead to longer simulations and
            more accurate results. At the lowest aceptable timestep of 1,
            the results can have an error up to 5% but increasing the
            timestep to 4 should drop errors to below 1%. (Default: 1).
            The following values are acceptable:
            (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60)
        _cool_cop_: An optional number which the cooling load will be divided by to
            account for the relative importance of cooling loads compared
            to heating loads (aka. the Coefficient of Performance or COP).
            For most cooling systems, this is value greater than 1, though
            how much greater varies widely between cooling systems and it is
            ultimately a function of how close the temperature of the cooling
            system's heat sink is to the room temperature setpoints. If set to 1,
            the output cooling will be the energy that must be removed from the
            _rooms to meet the setpoint (aka. the cooling demand). (Default: 1).
        _heat_cop_: An optional number which the heating load will be divided by to
            account for the relative importance of heating loads compared
            to cooling loads (aka. the Coefficient of Performance or COP).
            For fuel-based systems like gas boilers, this value tends to be
            less than 1 in order to represent the efficiency of the boiler
            and account for losses of heat, such as that through flue gases.
            For certain electric systems like heat pumps, this can be a value
            greater than 1 as such pumps may be able to pump more heat energy
            into a room per unit of electricity consumed. If set to 1, the
            output will be the energy that must be added to the _rooms to meet
            the setpoint (aka. the heating demand). (Default: 1).
        run_bal_: Set to True to have the full load balance computed after the
            simulation is run. This ensures that data collections for various
            terms of the load balance are output from the "balance".
            This can help explain why the loads are what they are but can
            also increase the component run time. (Default: False).
        _run: Set to "True" to run the simulation to obtain annual loads. This can
            also be the integer 2 to run the simulation while being able to see
            the simulation process (with a batch window).

    Returns:
        report: A report of the energy simulation run.
        total_load: A list of numbers for the 4-5 output load terms normalized by the floor
             area of the input _rooms. Units are kWh/m2. They are ordered
            as follows.
            _
            * cooling
            * heating
            * lighting
            * electric equipment
            * gas equipment (if the input rooms have it)
            * process load (if the input rooms have it)
            * service hot water (if the input rooms have it)
        cooling: A monthly Data Collection for the cooling load intensity in kWh/m2.
        heating: A monthly Data Collection for the heating load intensity in kWh/m2.
        lighting: A monthly Data Collection for the lighting load intensity in kWh/m2.
        equip: A monthly Data Collection for the equipment load intensity in kWh/m2.
            Typically, this is only the load from electric equipment but, if
            the attached _rooms have gas equipment, this will be a list of two
            data collections for electric and gas equipment respectively.
        process: A monthly Data Collection for the process load intensity in kWh/m2.
        hot_water: A monthly Data Collection for the service hot water load intensity
            in kWh/m2.
        balance: A list of monthly data collections for the various terms of the
            floor-normalized load balance in kWh/m2. Will be None unless
            run_bal_ is set to True.
