# honeybee-grasshopper-energy

:honeybee: :green_book: :fire: Honeybee Energy plugin for Grasshopper (aka. honeybee[+]).

This repository contains all energy modeling Grasshopper components for the honeybee
plugin. The package includes both the userobjects (`.ghuser`) and the Python
source (`.py`). Note that this library only possesses the Grasshopper components
and, in order to run the plugin, the core libraries must be installed in a way that
they can be found by Rhino (see dependencies).

The honeybee-grasshopper-energy plugin has the following dependencies on core libraries:

* [ladybug-core](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/ladybug)
* [ladybug-geometry](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/ladybug-geometry)
* [ladybug-comfort](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/ladybug-comfort)

## Other Required Components

The honeybee-grasshopper-energy plugin also requires the Grasshopper components within the
following repositories to be installed in order to work correctly:

* [ladybug-grasshopper](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/ladybug-grasshopper)
